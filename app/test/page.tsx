Once youve tasted the food, you know it must be cooked by someone with years of experience. True enough, the cook is an elderly lady, with a middle-aged man, who probably her son, serving customers. This plateful of glutinous rice n fried bee hoon topped with cabbages n a fried egg is only $3. They should be charging more for such a generous helping of delicious food. Please support them",
